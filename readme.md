## What does it do ?

### File picking

1. Open fm `:FmPickerToggle`. Your current buffer is selected.
2. Move to a file and press `Enter` to pick it. The window is hidden.

You can quit fm with `q`.

### Deleting / moving a file in fm 

1. Open fm `:FmPickerToggle`
2. Delete a file opened in a neovim buffer. Close fm with `q`
3. The buffer is removed.

If you rename a file instead of deleting it, nvim does the buffer renaming for us.
